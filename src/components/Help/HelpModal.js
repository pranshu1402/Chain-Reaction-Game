			<li>Each player is assigned a color initially</li>
			<li>
				Players can only place a sphere in an empty block or the one filled with
				their assigned colored spheres.
			</li>
			<li>
				When two or more spheres are placed together in the same block, they
				collates and becomes unstable.
			</li>
			<li>
				Each block has certain capacity to contain these spheres at a time. i.e.
				Blocks in the corners can only handle 1 sphere. Blocks at the grid edges
				other than corners can hold 2 spheres and Rest of the blocks can contain
				upto 3 spheres.
			</li>
			<li>
				When a player tries to insert more sphere than the block capacity:
				<ul>
					<li>{`The unstable spheres reacts & explodes.`}</li>
					<li>
						{`Each adjacent blocks receives a sphere, existing sphere gets
							overlapped & converted to the same color.`}
					</li>
					<li>
						The explosions might result in overloading of the adjacent blocks
						and the chain reaction of explosion continues until every block
						becomes stable.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				The winner is the one who eliminates other players by overlapping their
				existing spheres on board.
